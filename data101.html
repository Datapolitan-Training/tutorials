# The Value of Data
???
+ Facilitator prompts participants to reflect on the value of data in their work
+ Helpful to ask "how" when presented with reasons like "it tells us what happened" in order to get them thinking about the more intrinsic value of data
+ Also prompt to think about how they would manage something without data (experience, anecdote, etc.), particularly some process, office, effort with lots of elements or moving parts

--

+ Data tells a story about something that's happened
--

+ Can describe what happened directly or indirectly
--

+ Ex: "are the parks worst 10-10:59am? Why or why not?"

> Facts do not "speak for themselves." They speak for or against competing theories. Facts divorced from theory or visions are mere isolated curiosities.

## -Thomas Sowell *A Conflict of Visions*
???
+ Facilitator has participant read the quote and invites the class to reflect
+ Some will take this as talking about manipulation of data. It's more about the manipulation of context. The numbers aren't wrong, but are misused or not applied in the right context
